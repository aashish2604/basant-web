# Basant 2024
Basant is the official alumni reunion of IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. The reunion is one of the most emotional times of the institute’s calendar as the batch that had passed out 50 years back returns to the campus to reminisce about their old college memories. In order to make Basant memorable, the institute’s cultural clubs organize various cultural programs for the alumni, like Kavi Sammelan. Many indoor and outdoor sports activities are also organized. Various charitable events take place at the campus, along with the presentation of projects which can be supported by the alumni. The annual ISMAA meet is held during the same time wherein chairholders, budget, awardees and objectives are decided for the upcoming year.
